My Awesome Project

This website was made for a client who is a hair stylist. It acts as a landing page and a contact page for her. It is currently on her business cards and flyers.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The website is pretty simple. It's all one page and starts with an about the stylist section for introduction. It is then followed up with a section that describes the services she offers. After that is a section with a before and after of her client. And finally it ends with a contact section which messages go directly to her email.
